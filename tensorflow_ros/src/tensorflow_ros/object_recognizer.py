"""Wrapper class around a TensorFlow neural net to classify an image"""

# Threading in TensorFlow is interesting...
# First: ```finalize()``` the graph
# Then: Create the ```self.session``` in the main thread
# In the function called in the background: use ```with self.session.as_default() as sess:```
